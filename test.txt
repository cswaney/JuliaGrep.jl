Ingredients:
3 large eggs
Salt and pepper to taste
1 tablespoon butter or oil
1/4 cup shredded cheese (optional)
1/4 cup diced vegetables (such as bell peppers, onions, or mushrooms)
1/4 cup cooked ham or bacon (optional)

Instructions:
1. Prepare the Ingredients: Crack the eggs into a bowl, add salt and pepper, and whisk until well combined. Prepare any fillings you want to add to the omelette, such as cheese, vegetables, or meats.
2. Preheat the Pan: Heat a non-stick skillet over medium-high heat and add the butter or oil. Allow it to melt and coat the pan evenly.
3. Cook the Eggs: Pour the beaten eggs into the pan. Let them cook undisturbed for a minute. As the edges begin to set, use a spatula to gently lift the edges and tilt the pan to allow uncooked egg to flow underneath.
4. Add Fillings: Once the eggs are mostly set but still slightly runny on top, sprinkle your desired fillings over one half of the omelette.
5. Fold and Cook: Use the spatula to carefully fold the omelette in half, covering the fillings. Let it cook for another minute or until the cheese is melted and the eggs are cooked through.
6. Serve: Slide the omelette onto a plate and serve immediately. Enjoy your delicious homemade omelette!
